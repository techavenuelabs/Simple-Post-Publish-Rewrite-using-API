A WordPress plugin to publish and rewrite text content into articles automatically using OpenAI's GPT model.

== Description ==

Simple Post Publish & Rewrite using API is a WordPress plugin that allows users to publish and rewrite text content into articles automatically. The plugin leverages OpenAI's GPT model for content generation and rewriting, making it easier to create articles with minimal effort. Additionally, any associated images (thumbnails) are automatically saved to the WordPress media library. Developers can use this API to integrate into their projects and handle auto rewrite & publishing.

=== Key Features ===
- **Publish & Rewrite Content**: Using OpenAI's GPT model, the plugin can publish new posts and rewrite existing content into well-structured news articles.
- **API Integration**: You can access the pluginâ€™s functionality via a RESTful API, making it easy to integrate with external scripts and applications (like PHP, Python, Curl, etc.) using HTTP POST requests.
- **Image Handling**: The plugin saves any associated image URL as a thumbnail image in the WordPress media library.
- **Flexible Content Generation**: The plugin allows you to customize the content generation, including generating a title, rewriting content, and adding categories and tags.
- **Automatic Post Creation**: Generate content automatically from external sources, scripts, or applications, saving time and streamlining content management.
